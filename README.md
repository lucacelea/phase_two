# Bloodbaine and **you** in phase two

A quick note to start with: during progression we will try to stick to our 3 hour schedules. We will progress with a focused mindset, but ultimately we are here to have fun as a team. Enjoy these new and exciting raids we are about to face.

## Group setup

Before each raid, the table below will be updated to reflect the group composition of that day. I will use strictly character names so new guild members aren't left in the dark. Each entry in the table receives a number which will be used for assignments. This is to increase reusability of the sheet and to avoid confusion.

## Serpentshrine Cavern

Before we can beat the mighty first boss of SSC, we need to clear trash. This trash does require some paying attention to.

There are a few mobs to watch out for:


- [Coilfang Hate-Screamer](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21339/coilfang-hate-screamer)
    - Immune to CC
    - AOE silence 30 yards around herself
    - Arcane blasts nearby enemies
    - Moderate melee damage
- [Serpentshrine Sporebat](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21246/serpentshrine-sporebat)
    - Vulnerable to CC
    - Charges furthest target for moderate melee damage
    - Coilfang Beast-Tamers can enrage them, making them immune to CC
- [Serpentshrine Beast-Tamer](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21221/coilfang-beast-tamer)
    - Immune to CC
    - Cleaves
    - Can enrage Serpentshrine Sporebats, making them immune to CC

For these types of packs: 
> Kill Beast-Tamers >> CC Sporebats >> Kill Hate-Screamers >> Kill Sporebats
