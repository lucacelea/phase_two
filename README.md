# Bloodbaine and **you** in phase two
---

A quick note to start with: during progression we will try to stick to our 3 hour schedules. We will progress with a focused mindset, but ultimately we are here to have fun as a team. Enjoy these new and exciting raids we are about to face.

Besides that, this document is in case you are new to SSC and you want a good idea of what you are getting in to. If you have a good idea of what is going on and just want a quick view of the assignments [**here**]() you go.

## Group setup

Before each raid, the table below will be updated to reflect the group composition of that day. I will use strictly character names so new guild members aren't left in the dark. Each entry in the table receives a number which will be used for assignments. This is to increase reusability of the sheet and to avoid confusion.

## Serpentshrine Cavern

### Trash leading up to **Hydross the Unstable**

Before we can beat the mighty first boss of SSC, we need to clear trash. This trash does require some paying attention to. There are a few types of packs before the first boss.

**FIRST TYPE OF PACK**

[**Coilfang Hate-Screamer**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21339/coilfang-hate-screamer)
- Immune to CC
- AOE silence 30 yards around herself
- Arcane blasts nearby enemies
- Moderate melee damage

[**Serpentshrine Sporebat**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21246/serpentshrine-sporebat)
- Vulnerable to CC
- Charges furthest target for moderate melee damage
- Coilfang Beast-Tamers can enrage them, making them immune to CC

[**Serpentshrine Beast-Tamer**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21221/coilfang-beast-tamer)
- Immune to CC
- Cleaves
- Can enrage Serpentshrine Sporebats, making them immune to CC

> Kill Beast-Tamers >> CC Sporebats >> Kill Hate-Screamers >> Kill Sporebats

**SECOND TYPE OF PACK**

[**Underbog Colossus**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=21221/coilfang-beast-tamer)

These are like the father of the ones in Steamvaults. Nature resistance helps a lot on these. They are also similar to the Anubisath Sentinels or the Core Hounds. They spawn with random abilities that are unique to them.

- *Type A*: does a [**Spore Quake**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=38976/spore-quake). Shit's nasty. 2,000 damage per tick and a chance to knock down. Melee need to get to at least 30 yards away.
- *Type B*: 
    - does an [**Acid Geyser**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=41573/acid-geyser). Works exactly the same as the Netherspite breath. Everyone needs to spread out.
    - Affects players with a DOT which afterwards spawns a little parasite. Kill it, or it reinfects other players.
- *Type C*: these enrage. Hunters need to [**Tranquilizing Shot**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=19801/tranquilizing-shot)

They also have abilities when they die. Notably they can either spawn a load of adds or two big ones. The other abilities I'm sure will speak for themselves. Goblins can herb these giants for a nice profit. [**hehe**](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcustom-gwent.com%2FcardsBg%2F57086c5f7494678b06d3098c4502ca35.jpeg&f=1&nofb=1)

### **Hydross the Unstable**: "The melee killer"

The fight is split up in two phases. A **Frost** and a **Nature** phase. We will have to manually move the boss from phase to phase to prevent us dying to the **Mark** mechanic. When the boss is moved across the middle he changes to an according phase. **North is the Frost** phase and **South is the Nature** phase. This also triggers a **THREAT WIPE**, which means no damage is supposed to go out during the transition.

The **Mark** mechanic is a specific debuff for either phase that stacks up slowly the longer you are in a phase. This makes it harder to stay in a given phase. We will **swap to either side around 100% of the Mark debuff**.

During the **Frost** phase, the boss targets players with [**Water Tomb**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=38235/water-tomb), an AOE stun which deals moderate DOT damage. Everyone needs to be at least 8 yards apart.

![**Nature** phase](images/nature_phase.png)

During the **Nature** phase, the boss puts a [**Vile Sludge**](https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=38246/vile-sludge) debuff on a random player, reducing their healing taken and doing moderate DOT damage.
